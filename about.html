                        In 17th and 18th century Europe, criminals who were sentenced to death by hanging could demand
                        the "Rite
                        of
                        Words and Life."

                        In the "Rite of Words and Life" a criminal to be hanged was strung up over a 5 legged stand, and
                        a board
                        with a series of short ropes representing a word was displayed. The Executioner would pick the
                        word, and
                        would use charcoal to mark correctly guessed letters on the dashes of the board, and incorrect
                        letters
                        to
                        the side. At every incorrect guess the executioner would use a sledge hammer or axe to knock
                        away a
                        single
                        leg of the stand. 5 wrong guesses, and the criminal was hanged. If the entire word was filled in
                        correctly
                        or guessed, the condemned would be set free from that sentence and not tried again on that
                        crime.

                        The irony here was that almost all of those criminals were illiterate.

                        Either way, we have preserved that old tradition in our own small way.

                        Hangman is a guessing game. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s)
                        tries to
                        guess
                        it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
                        The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.
                        If the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the
                        diagram, the
                        guesser loses.
                        The guesser can win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the
                        word,
                        before
                        the diagram is completed.
                        The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word.

                        In our version of the game the computer will be thinking of a popular movie.
                        You have to guess which movie it is.  
                        We will portray the death of Viserys Targaryen from the HBO series
                        Game of Thrones instead of the hanged stick figure.
                        With each incorrect guess Viserys will be one step closer to death.
                        You are allowed only 5 mistakes.
